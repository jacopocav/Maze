# Maze size, in terms of cells. Cells can be non-traversable (walls) or traversable (empty).
# The generation algorithm requires odd sizes, so if an even number is inserted, the
# effective size used will be that number +1.

# Default: 65 x 65

# Percentage of randomness used in part of the maze generation algorithm
# Lowering the value will generate longer and more intricate paths, with few intersections and dead ends.
# Raising the value will generate shallower paths, with frequent intersections and dead ends.
# Min: 0
# Max: 100
# Default: 25

# Number of alarms that are placed in the maze.
# Default: 5

# Allows to choose whether the generated mazes are braided or not.
# Braided mazes have no dead ends and are generally easier to traverse, since they reduce backtracking.

# Allows to "cheat" by enabling flight.
# The player can float above the maze and move freely. For the controls, please refer to the readme.
